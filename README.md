# Automated Garden Watering System

## Project Overview

This project implements an automated garden watering system using an Arduino microcontroller. The system aims to provide a convenient and efficient way to water plants, ensuring they receive the necessary moisture without manual intervention.

## Features

* **Automatic Watering:** The system automatically waters plants based on pre-defined schedules or moisture sensor readings.
* **Arduino Control:** The system utilizes an Arduino microcontroller for controlling the watering process.
* **Accident Avoidance System:**  The project includes documentation on an accident avoidance system, likely to prevent overwatering or other issues.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

* Arduino IDE: Download and install the Arduino IDE from [https://www.arduino.cc/en/software](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software).
* Arduino Board: Ensure you have a compatible Arduino board for the project.

### Setup

1. **Connect the Arduino Board:** Connect the Arduino board to your computer using a USB cable.
2. **Open the Arduino IDE:** Launch the Arduino IDE and open the `automatic_garden_watering_system1.ino` file.
3. **Upload the Code:** Compile and upload the code to your Arduino board using the Arduino IDE's "Upload" button.

## Usage

1. **Configure the Code:** Modify the `automatic_garden_watering_system1.ino` file to adjust the watering schedule, sensor settings, and other parameters based on your garden's needs.
2. **Connect Sensors and Actuators:** Connect the moisture sensors, pump, or other necessary components to the Arduino board according to the wiring diagram provided in the project documentation.
3. **Power the System:** Power the Arduino board and the associated components.
4. **Monitor and Adjust:** Observe the system's operation and adjust settings as needed to ensure optimal performance.

**Note:** The project documentation, including `Accident Avoidance system using Arduino.pdf`, provides detailed information on system setup, wiring, and troubleshooting.
